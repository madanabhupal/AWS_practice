EC2: elastic compute cloud
--------------------------------
It is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.  

Key Features of EC2:
1. Scalability: EC2 allows users to quickly scale up or down their compute resources based on demand.
2. Flexibility: Users can choose from a variety of instance types, operating systems, and software packages.
3. Cost-Effectiveness: EC2 offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing users to pay only for the resources they use.
4. Security: EC2 provides robust security features, including network firewalls, encryption, and identity and access management.

instance types: virtual services which we create on EC2 is called instances.

EC2 configuration components:
operating system
storage
network
security

Steps to launch an EC2 instance:
1. name of the instance
2. choose an amazon machine image(AMI)
3. choose an instance types
4. key pair
5. network configuration
6. configure storage
7. advanced settings

note: if you use linux then ec2-user
if you use ubuntu then ubuntu
